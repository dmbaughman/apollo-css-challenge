# Apollo CSS exercise

The scenario for this exercise is that we just received some design mockups from our agency and we would like you to jump in and help write the styles for these buttons.

## Requirements

- Create a set of classes that apply the desired styles to all the elements on the `index.html` page so they appear identical.
- Use colors from the color palette to match designs as closely as possible.  Where exact matches don't exist in the palette, you may lighten or darken colors from the palette to approximate the mockup.  We're not testing your color matching here, so just make it look close.
- Ensure that the buttons look correct when used on a dark background.
- Include styles for small (compact) size variation.
- Give all state changes a consistent, smooth transition (e.g. hover, active).

## Caveats

- Font from mockup is Proxima Nova, but don't worry about that matching
- Ignore the annoying reverb animation thing
- The four elements per row do not correspond to the four states, so when loading the page the first group should all look blue (default primary) and the second group should all be white with a gray border (default secondary)

## Bonus

Add styles to account for the touchscreen and long label styles.  We'd prefer not to use additional classes for these two, so how would you approach this problem?

## Resources

## Some helpful details

- The shadows for the button hover state are included in the `_variables.scss` module.
